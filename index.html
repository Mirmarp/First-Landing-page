                <h5>Why did I do Ironhack?</h5>

                <p>I have always been interested in how people behave, learn and notice in different ways. 
                    I was studying education, student counselling and psychology but I wasn't sure where exactly I would 
                    like to work in the future. I was working for some years in school world but after some time I felt the work 
                    was missing something. In the end, I was invited to test a new program by a UX designer and I realised the work is 
                    exactly what I was looking for. Didn't take a long and I was already looking for a bootcamp to get into the designer world.
                    Ironahck had a good reviews and I decided to apply. Not regretting that decicion for sure! </p>
         
        <h5>What would I like to do in the future?</h5>
        <p>My strongest skills are on UX and I would like to start my new career as a junior UX designer. 
            My passion is also to learn UI so I wish the future job I would have a possibility to improve 
            my skill on that area as well. </p>
